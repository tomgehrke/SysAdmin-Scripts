# SysAdmin-Scripts

PowerShell Scripts for System Administrators

## Introduction

These are scripts that I've developed to address specific needs that I have run into as a sysadmin. However, I have written them in a way that they can be used in other similar scenarios.

Even if they cannot be used as-is, large parts should be reusable in new scripts because nobody likes to reinvent the wheel if they don't have to. (A good admin is a lazy admin.)

This is a work in progress. Feel free to use and/or contribute as you will.

## The Scripts

### Backup-FolderAcls.ps1

### Backup-GroupMembership.ps1

### Disable-ADUsersByList.ps1

### Export-DNS.ps1

### Get-NewComputers.ps1

### Restore-GroupMembership.ps1
